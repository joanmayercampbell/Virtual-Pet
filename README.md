# Virtual-Pet

This program allows a user to define a pet with a name,animal type,number of legs, weight and if it has a tail.

The user is prompted to click the full screen icon so that the entire menu and output can be displayed properly.

The screen then displays the description of the Virtual Pet, an animal figurine (changes size depending on weight),  and the number status of the the following urges: Hunger,Thirst,Pee,Poop,tiredness,boredom. The appropriate action affects the numbers, time and menu actions also affect those numbers. When the numbers reach 75, the numbers turn red and the console will beep.

If any number turns 100, your animal dies.

Enjoy!!
